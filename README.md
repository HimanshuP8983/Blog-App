# Blog-App
Blogging app has been built in Django Framework with the CRUD feature for the blogs. Authentication of the user profile for situations like forget password and resetting it through the mail has been implemented. Password reset feature takes mailId of user as input on which the mail is sent. AWS S3 is used to store profile pictures. Heroku deployment using GIT is done. Please go through the application by registering and writing a blog.
